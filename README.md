# Flatmate

## objective

Main drive that inspired the idea for this project was from our own experience of having lived in flats with various other people. We found that when people share a same living space, various chores and commitments  between tenants of the house are hard to keep track of and an app that can mediate possible conflicts could be convenient.

“FlateMate”’s main functions comprise of calendar, chatting system and searching engine that allows people to enlist/ search for a property to potential tenants with minimal.

Our app will offer functions that allow maintaining chores like dish washing, vacuum, laundry, cleaning toilet etc schedule that will be recorded in calendar format so that users can easily verify their roles/ duty for the week.

Chatting system will be put in place for tenants of a specific household that will allow them to communicate arrangements with others for a more stable relationships.

When tenants decide to leave their associated establishment they will be prompted to rate their experience with their flat mates and/ or house owner for prospect flatees’ future reference.

Our app interface will be user-friendly so every generation will be able to use it without any difficulty. This app will be based on android first and iOS version will also be published shortly.

Our future goal is establishing Database for storing property detail so when we implement search engine later on, user is able to search from our database.

Our final goal will be publishing our app onto Google Playstore.  And for the future plan, we will be regularly updating and maintaining our app to increase the user.
